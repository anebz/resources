# Morphology

study of internal structure of words.
*Morphological analysis*: the final [s] of 'nuts' expresses plural meaning when it occurs at the end of a noun. *Morphological structure* exists if there are groups of words that show identical partial resemblances in both form and meaning.

*Definition 1*: morphology is the study of systematic covariation in the form and meaning of words. This form-meaning covariation has to occur systematically in groups of words.

*Constituents*: nuts = nut-s, 2 constituents. the smallest meaningful constituents of words that can be identified are called *morphemes*: break-ing, hope-less, re-write, re-writ-ing, etc.

*Definition 2*: morphology is the study of the combination of morphemes to yield words. but doesn't work in all cases, so better definition1.

* *Isolating*: almost no morphology --> extreme degree of analyticity. Yoruba and Vietnamese. very few morphemes per word.
* *Analytic*: languages like Yoruba, Vietnamese, English, where morphology plays a relatively modest role.
* *Synthetic*: morphology plays a more important role, Sumerian, Swahili, Lezgian.
* *Polysynthetic*: extraordinary amount of morphology and many compound words. west greenlandic. a lot of morphemes per word.


# Phonology

sound structure
*Phonological segments*: nuts = [n^ts], they generally have no meaning, purely contrastive value

# Syntax

sentence structure.

*Deifnition*: the study of the combination of words to yield sentences.
