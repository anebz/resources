## 1. General Thinking Concepts

### 1.1. [Inversion](https://fs.blog/2013/10/inversion/)

* think backwards, problem-solving technique.
* consider what you want to avoid instead of what you want to get.
* avoiding stupidity is easier than seeking brilliance: spend less time trying to be brilliant and more time trying to avoid obvious stupidity. Ex, tennis:
    - pros play to win, no one makes mistakes but sometimes someone does sth brilliant and they win.
    - amateurs play to lose, people make many mistakes so the first one to make mistakes loses.
    - how to win in amateur level: don't play to win, avoid making mistakes.
* spend time thinking about the opposite of what you want.

### 1.2. Falsification / confirmation bias

* confirmation bias
    - tendency to confirm existing beliefs, rather than questioning them or seeking new ones.
    - when we have a theory, we look for evidence to prove us right.
    - even when shown evidence to contradict a biased view, we may still interpret it in a manner that reinforces our current perspective.
    - “The eye sees only what the mind is prepared to comprehend.” — Robertson Davies.
* falsification
    - The only way to test the validity of any theory is to prove it wrong.
    - A method is termed scientific if it can be stated in such a way that a certain defined result would cause it to be proved false.
    - pseudo-knowledge and pseudo-science are unfalsifiable, the conditions under which they would be shown false are never stated.

### 1.3. [Circle of competence](https://fs.blog/2013/12/mental-model-circle-of-competence/)

* we all have areas in which we know our stuff. areas outside: we're ignorant about them and we're ignorant of our own ignorance.
* when making decisions, define the perimeter and attend to, operate inside the circle.
* “I’m no genius. I’m smart in spots — but I stay around those spots.” — Tom Watson Sr., Founder of IBM.
* Our circle of competence can be widened, but only slowly and over time. Mistakes are most often made when straying from this discipline.
* You have to figure out what your own aptitudes are. If you play games where other people have the aptitudes and you don't, you're going to lose. And that's as close to certain as any prediction that you can make. You have to figure out where you've got an edge. 

### 1.4. [Occam's Razor](https://fs.blog/2017/05/mental-model-occams-razor/) also #explaining

* we favour simple explanations rather than complicated ones.
* among competing hypotheses, select the one with the fewest assumptions.
* avoid looking for excessively complex solutions to a problem and focus on what works, given the circumstances.
* The simpler a hypothesis is, the more easily it can be proved or falsified.
* Einstein: everything should be made as simple as possible, but not simpler.
* crimes: Occam’s razor is used in conjunction with experience and statistical knowledge. A woman is statistically more likely to be killed by a male partner than any other person.

### 1.5. [Hanlon's Razor](https://fs.blog/2017/04/mental-model-hanlons-razor/)also #explaining

* don't attribute to malice what can be attributed to stupidity.
* when things go wrong, there's usually no conspiracy against you.
* Hanlon’s razor allows us to give people the benefit of the doubt and have more empathy in respect to confirmation bias: if we expect malicious intent, we are likely to attribute it wherever possible.

* The German general Kurt von Hammerstein-Equord used Hanlon’s razor to assess his men, saying: "I divide my officers into four groups. There are clever, diligent, stupid, and lazy officers. Usually two characteristics are combined. Some are clever and diligent – their place is the General Staff. The next lot are stupid and lazy – they make up 90 percent of every army and are suited to routine duties. Anyone who is both clever and lazy is qualified for the highest leadership duties, because he possesses the intellectual clarity and the composure necessary for difficult decisions. One must beware of anyone who is stupid and diligent – he must not be entrusted with any responsibility because he will always cause only mischief."

* A similar issue has occurred a number of times with YouTube content policies. When videos discussing LGBTQ matters were filtered on the restrictive viewing mode, many people took extreme offense at this. The reality is that this was an algorithm error and not a case of homophobia on the part of the programmers. Countless videos which do not discuss anything related to LGBTQ issues have also been filtered. This shows it to be a case of confirmation bias, wherein people see the malice they expect to see.

### 1.6. [The map is not the territory](https://fs.blog/2015/11/map-and-territory/)

* the map/abstraction of reality is not reality. the description of the thing is not the thing itself. The model is not reality.
* we are so reliant on abstraction that we will frequently use an incorrect model simply because we feel any model is preferable to no model.
    - the drunk looking for his keys under the streetlight because “That’s where the light is!”.
* the map may be incorrect, a reduction of reality, in need of interpretation.
* the human brain takes great leaps and shortcuts in order to make sense of its surroundings.
    - the sperm and the egg — after the first good idea gets in, the door closes.


### 1.7. [First principles thinking](https://fs.blog/2018/04/first-principles/)

* separate the underlying ideas or facts from any assumptions based on them. what remains are the essentials.
* if you know the first principles of something, you can build the rest of your knowledge around them to produce something new.

* A first principle is a foundational proposition/assumption that stands alone. We cannot deduce first principles from any other proposition or assumption.
    - play stealer: reasons by analogy, coach: reasons by first principles. 
    - cook: uses a recipe. creates something with slight variations to what's already been created.
    - chef: knows the raw ingredients and how to combine them.

    - Socratic questioning:
        + 1.Clarifying your thinking and explaining the origins of your ideas
            * Why do I think this? What exactly do I think?
        + 2.Challenging assumptions
            * How do I know this is true? What if I thought the opposite?
        + 3.Looking for evidence
            * How can I back this up? What are the sources?
        + 4.Considering alternative perspectives
            * What might others think? How do I know I am correct?
        + 5.Examining consequences and implications
            * What if I am wrong? What are the consequences if I am?
        + 6.Questioning the original questions
            * Why did I think that? Was I correct? What conclusions can I draw from the reasoning process?


### 1.8. [Thought experiment](https://fs.blog/2017/06/thought-experiment-how-einstein-solved-difficult-problems/) (Gedankenexperiment)

* devices of the imagination used to investigate the nature of things.
* they help us learn from past mistakes and avoid future ones.

* “All truly wise thoughts have been thought already thousands of times; but to make them truly ours, we must think them over again honestly, until they take root in our personal experience.” — Goethe

* The benefit of thought experiments (as opposed to aimless rumination) is their structure. In an organized manner, thought experiments allow us to challenge intellectual norms, move beyond the boundaries of ingrained facts, comprehend history, make logical decisions, foster innovative ideas, and widen our sphere of reference.

* Despite being improbable or impractical, thought experiments should be possible, in theory.

### 1.9. [Second-order thinking](https://fs.blog/2016/04/second-order-thinking/)

* *first-order thinking*: anticipating the immediate results of their actions. It's simplistic and superficial. People look for simple, easy and defendable things.
* *second-order thinking*: thinking farther ahead and thinking holistically, before sth happens. Consider our actions and immediate consequences, but also the subsequent effects of those actions. It's deep, complex and convoluted. People think in terms of interactions, time and system dynamics. They're aware of iatrogenics and our bias towards intervention. 
    - [Iatrogenics](https://fs.blog/2013/10/iatrogenics/): someone whose actions cause more harm than benefit.
        + Nowadays it's used to refer to any effect resulting from an intervention in excess of gain.
            * It's easier to see effects when they are immediate and visible, less so when they are delayed or could be explained by multiple causes.
            * If we are to intervene, we need a solid idea of not only the benefits of our interventions but also the harm we may cause.
* "Experience is what you got when you didn't get what you wanted" - Randy Pausch.
* Steps:
    - What are the key variables and how do they interact?
    - Where is the leverage?
    - If I take this action, what happens next?
* Improving your ability to think
    1. And then what?
    2. Consequences in 10mins, 10 months, 10 years?
    3. Templates with 1st, 2nd and 3rd order consequences

### 1.10. [Probabilistic thinking](https://fs.blog/2018/05/probabilistic-thinking/)

Trying to estimate, using math and logic, the likelihood of any specific outcome coming to pass.

#### 1.10.1. Bayesian thinking

How to adjust probabilities when we encounter new data. Given we have limited but useful information about the world, and are constantly encountering new information, we should take into account what we already know when learning something new. 

#### 1.10.2. Fat-tailed curves

Different from the normal distribution, where the extremes are predictable because there can only be so much deviation from the mean, in a fat-tailed curve there's no real cap on extreme events. The most common outcomes become the average and the non-common ones are unlikely but not so unlikely.

#### 1.10.3. Asymmetries

metaprobability: the probability that my probability estimates aren't good. People consistently overestimate their confidence in their probabilistic estimates. Another common asymmetry is people's ability to estimate the effect of traffic on travel time. When we leave on time, we never arrive 20% early, always 20% late. Our estimation errors are asymmetric, skewing in a single direction. 

## 2. Numeracy

### 2.1. Permutations and combinations

how things can be ordered and combined, and how we should think about things

### 2.2. Algebraic equivalence

Algebra allowed us to demonstrate mathematically and abstractly that two seemingly Different things could be the same. Knowing the basics of algebra can allow us to understand a variety of important results

### 2.3. Randomness

much of the world is composed of random, non-sequential, non-ordered events. We're fooled by random effects when we attribute causality to things that are actually outside our control. If we don't correct this, we'll see things as being more predictable than they are and act accordingly.

### 2.4. Stochastic processes (Poisson, Markov, Random Walk)

A stochastic process is a random statistical process and encompasses a wide variety of processes in which the movement of an individual variable can be impossible to predict but can be thought through probabilistically. 

### 2.5. Compounding

Process by which we add interest to a fixed sum, which then earns interest on the previous sum and the newly added interest, and then earns interest on that amount, and so on ad infinitum. It's an exponential effect. Money, ideas and relationships compound.

### 2.6. [Multiplying by zero](https://fs.blog/2016/08/multiplicative-systems/)

A failure in one area can negate great efforts in all other areas. Fixing the zero often has a much greater effect than trying to enlarge the other areas. Multiplicative systems, the weakest link in the chain. **A system is no stronger than its weakest component**.

### 2.7. Churn

Every year, a number of customers are lost and must be replaced. Standing still is the equivalent of losing. A constant figure is periodically lost and must be replaced before any new figures are added over the top.

### 2.8. Law or large numbers

One of the fundamental underlying assumptions of probability is that as more instances of an event occur, the actual results will converge on the expected ones. If I know that the average man is 5 feet 10 inches tall, I am far more likely to get an average of 5′10″ by selecting 500 men at random than 5 men at random. 

The law of small numbers states that small samples can and should be looked at with great scepticism.

### 2.9. Normal distribution

A meaningful central average and increasingly rare standard deviations from that average when correctly sampled (central limit theorem). Human height and weight, etc. But not all processes follow this distribution.

### 2.10. [Power laws](https://fs.blog/2017/11/power-laws/)

This process doesn't fit the normal distribution, whereby one quantity varies with another's exponent rather than linearly. The Richter scale for example, an 8-level earthquake is 10x more destructive than a 7

### 2.11. [Regression to the mean](https://www.farnamstreetblog.com/2015/07/regression-to-the-mean/)

Statistically likely events aren't always causal ones. 

The notion of regression to the mean was first worked out by Sir Francis Galton. The rule goes that, in any series with complex phenomena that are dependent on many variables, where chance is involved, extreme outcomes tend to be followed by more moderate ones.

“Regression to the mean is not a natural law. Merely a statistical tendency. And it may take a long time before it happens.” — Peter Bevelin

### 2.12. Order of magnitude

In many, perhaps most, systems, quantitative description down to a precise figure is either impossible or useless (or both). For example, estimating the distance between our galaxy and the next one over is a matter of knowing not the precise number of miles, but how many zeroes are after the 1. Is the distance about 1 million miles or about 1 billion? This thought habit can help us escape useless precision.

## 3. Systems

### 3.1. Scale

Systems are sensitive to scale. Properties or behaviors tend to change when you scale them up or down. In studying complex system, scale and how properties change with it is important.

### 3.2. Law of diminishing returns

Mist important real-world results are subject to an eventual decrease of incremental value. Give money to a poor family, and they are no longer poor. But after a certain point, additional money won't improve the situation. Often the law of diminishing return veers into negative territory: giving too much money to the family might destroy them.

### 3.3. Pareto principle

This Italian man noticed that 80% of Italy was owned by 20% of the population. The principle states that a smal amount of some phenomenon causes a disproportionately large effect.

### 3.4. [Feedback loop](https://fs.blog/2011/10/mental-model-feedback-loops/)

All complex systems are subject to positive and negative feedback loops whereby A causes B, which in turn influences A and C, and so on. In a homoeostatic system, a change in A is often brought back into line by an opposite change in B to maintain the balance of the system, such as the temperature of the human body or the behaviour of an organized culture. A 'runaway feedback loop' decribes a situation in which the output of a reaction becomes its own catalyst.

### 3.5. [Chaos dynamics, butterfly effect](https://fs.blog/2017/08/the-butterfly-effect/)

Small changes/perturbations in initial conditions have massive downstream effects as near-inifinite feedback loops occur. A consequence of butterfly effects is that some aspects of physical systems (the weather in a few days into the future), or social systems (the behaviour of a group of human beings over a long period), are fundamentally unpredictable.

### 3.6. Preferential attachment, cumulative advantage

A preferential attachment situation occurs when the current leader is given more of the reward than the others, thereby tending to preserve or enhance the status of the leader.

### 3.7. Emergence

Higher level behaviour tends to emerge from the interaction of lower-order components. The result can be non-linear or exponential. An important resulting property of emergent behaviour is that it can't be predicted from simply studying the component parts.

### 3.8. Irreductibility

In most systems there are irreductible quantitative properties such as complexity, minimums, time and length. Below the irreductibility level, the desired result simply doesn't occur. Not by getting several women pregnant are babies born before, or reduce a successfully built car to a single part. These results are, to a defined point, irreducible.

### 3.9. [Tragedy of the commons](https://fs.blog/2011/08/the-tragedy-of-the-commons/)

In a system where a common resource is shared, with no individual responsible for the wellbeing of the resource, it will tend to be depleted over time. Unless people collaborate, each individual derives more personal benefit than the cost that they incur, therefore depleting the resource. Aristotle: ‘What is common to many is taken least care of, for all men have greater regard for what is their own than for what they possess in common with others.’

### 3.10. [Gresham's law](https://fs.blog/2009/12/mental-model-greshams-law/)

In a system of circulating currency, forged currency will tend to drive out real currency, as real currency is hoarded and forged currency is spent. In moral systems, bad behaviour drive out good behaviour. Whenever coins with precious metals have been used along with base metal coins of the same denomination, the bad coins have driven the good coins out of circulation.

### 3.11. Algorithms

An algorithm is an automated set of rules leading a series of steps or actions resulting in a desired outcome.

### 3.12. Fragility - robustness - antifragility

Refers to the responsiveness of a system to incremental negative variability. A fragile system is one in which additional negative variability has a disproportionately negative impact. A robust system tends to be neutral to the additional negative variability, and an antifragile system benefits. 

### 3.13. Backup systems/[redundancy](https://fs.blog/2011/07/mental-model-redundancy/)

A good engineer never assumes the perfect reliability of the components of the system, they build in redundancy to protect the integrity of the total system.

### 3.14. [Margin of safety](https://fs.blog/2013/12/margin-of-safety/)

Engineers also add a margin for error into all calculations, which is why modern bridges rarely fail.

### 3.15. Criticality

A system becomes critical when it's about to jump discretely from one phase to another. The marginal utility of the last unit before the phase change is wildly higher than any unit before it. Water turning from a liquid to a vapor when heated to a specific temperature, for example. "Critical mass" refers to the mass needed to have the critical event occur.

### 3.16. Network effects

A network becomes more valuable if there are more nodes added, network effect. If only one house has electricity, they have gained immense value. But if only one house has a telephone, its inhabitants have gained nothing of use.

### 3.17. Via negativa - omission/removal/avoidance of harm

In many systems, improvement is at best a result of removing bad elements rather than adding good elements. First, do no harm.

### 3.18. The Lindy effect

Refers to the life expectancy of a non-perishable object or idea being related to its current lifespan. If something las lasted for X years, it'd be expected on average to last another X years. Non-perishable objects lengthen their life expectancy as they continually survive. If humanity has been reading Shakespeare's plays for 500 years, it's expected that they read them for another 500.

### 3.19. Renormalization group

This technique allows thinking about physical and social systems at different scales. The application of a renormalization group to social systems allows us to understand why a small number of stubborn individuals can have a disproportionate impact if those around them follow suit on increasingly large scales.

### 3.20. Spring-loading

A system is spring-loaded if it's coiled in a certain direction, positive or negative. Positively spring-loading systems and relationships is important in a fundamentally unpredictable world to help protect us against negative events, and the reverse can be destructive.

### 3.21. [Complex adaptive systems](https://fs.blog/2014/04/mental-model-complex-adaptive-systems/)

Such a system can understand itself and change based on that understanding, social systems for example. The weather won't change based on an important forecaster's opinion, but the stock market might. Complex adaptive systems aren't predictable.

## 4. Physical world

### 4.1. Laws of thermodynamics

They describe energy in a closed system. The laws can't be escaped and they underlie the physical world. Useful energy is constantly being lost, and energy can't be created or destroyed.

### 4.2. Reciprocity

If I push a wall, the wall pushes back with the same force.

### 4.3. [Velocity](https://fs.blog/2018/03/speed-velocity/)

Not equivalent to speed. Velocity is speed plus vector, how fast something goes somewhere. Saying yes to everything is a quick road to mediocrity. How many things should you do? “as few as you can, as many as you must.”

### 4.4. [Relativity](https://www.farnamstreetblog.com/2017/05/galilean-relativity-invasion-scotland/)

An observer can't truly understand a system of which they themselves are part. Someone inside an airplane doesn't experience movement, but an outsider does.

### 4.5. [Activation energy](https://www.farnamstreetblog.com/2017/06/activation-energy/)

Actions require a critical level of activation energy to get a reaction started, such as fires. Carbon and oxygen aren't enough.

### 4.6. Catalysts

A catalyst either kick-starts or maintains a chemical reaction, but isn't itself a reactant. Social systems take on similar traits to catalysts.

### 4.7. [Leverage](https://www.farnamstreetblog.com/2017/06/leverage/)

"Give me a lever long enough and I shall move the world" - Archimedes. With a small amount of input force, it's possible to make a great output force through leverage. It's important to know where to apply this model to the human world.

### 4.8. Inertia

An object in motion with a certain vector wants to continue moving in that direction unless acted upon. Individuals, systems and organizations display the same effect. It allows them to minimize the use of energy, but can cause them to be destroyed or eroded.

### 4.9. Alloying

In the alloying process, 2+2 can equal 6. The alloy can be far stronger than the simple addition of the underlying elements. A combination of right elements in social systems or even individuals can create a 2+2=6 effect similar to alloying.

### 4.10. Viscosity

It's the measure of how hard it is for one layer of fluid to slide over another layer. If a liquid is hard to move, it's more viscous -> more resistance. For humans, viscosity isn't a problem, we deal with gravity and inertia. But with smaller particles, these phenomena become nothing compared to viscosity. When we change the scale, we change which forces are relevant.

## 5. The biological world

### 5.1. [Inventives](https://fs.blog/2017/10/bias-incentives-reinforcement/)

All creatures respond to incentives to keep themselves alive, it's the basic insight of biology. Constant incentives tend to cause a biological entity to have constant behavior. In the case of humans, these incentives can be hidden or intangible. The rule of life is to repeat what works and has been rewarded.

### 5.2. Copperation

Cooperation in biological systems is at various levels as important as competition. Without cooperation, no group survives. Cooperation and competition coexist at multiple levels.

The prisoner's dilemma is an application of game theory in which two prisoners are both better off cooperating with each other but if one cheats, the other is better off cheating.

### 5.3. Tendency to minimize energy output

Any biological organism that was wasteful with energy would be at a severe disadvantage for survival. Behavior is governed by a tendency to minimize energy usage when at all possible.

### 5.4. Adaptation

Species must adapt to their surroundings in order to survive, but adaptations done in an individual's lifetime aren't passed down genetically, as was once thought. Populations of species adapt through the process of evolution by natural selection, ast he most fit examples of the species replicate at an above-average rate.

### 5.5. Evolution by natural selection

Species evolve through random mutation and differential survival rates. Those best suited for survival tend to be preserved.

### 5.6. [The red queen effect](https://fs.blog/2012/10/the-red-queen-effect/)

In evolution by natural selection, there's an arms race among species competing for limited resources. When one species evolves an advantageous adaptation, a competing species must respond in kind or fail as a species. Standing still can mean falling behind. This arms race is called the red queen effect from the character in *Alice in Wonderland*, who said: 'it takes all the running you can do to stay in the same place'.

### 5.7. Replication

A fundamental building block of diverse biological life is high-fidelity replication. The fundamental unit of replication is the DNA molecule, which provides a blueprint for the offspring to be built from physical building blocks.

### 5.8. Hierarchical and other organizing instincts

Most complex biological organisms have an innate feel for how they should organize. Most organisms in the animal kingdom end up in hierarchical structures, and humans too (Stanford prison and Milgram experiment) Humans are biased towards being influenced by authority. We tend to look to the leader for guidance on behavior, especially in situations of stress and uncertainty.  Thus, authority figures have a responsibility to act well, whether they like it or not.

### 5.9. Self-preservation instincts

Without a strong self-preservation instinct in an organism's DNA, the organism disappears over time. The self-preservation instinct can cause violent, erratic and/or destructive behavior for those around them.

### 5.10. Simple physiological reward-seeking

All organisms feel pleasure and pain from simple chemical processes in their bodies which respond predictably to the outside world. Reward-seeking is an effective survival-promoting technique, but the same pleasure receptors can be co-opted to cause destructive behavior.

### 5.11. Exaptation

Trait developed for one purpose that's later used for another purpose, eyeballs for example. In a primitive form, it might have been used for something else. Once it was there, and once it developed, 3D sight became possible.

### 5.12. Ecosystems

Describes how groups of organisms coexist with the natural world. Most ecosystems display diverse forms of life talking different approaches to survival, and therefore behaving differently. Social systems have a resemblance to physical ecosystems.

### 5.13. Niches

Most organisms find a niche, a method of competing and behaving for survival. Usually a species selects a niche for which it is best adapted. The danger happens when many species compete for the same niche, which can cause an extinction.

### 5.14. Dunbar's number

The number of individuals a primate can get to know and trust closely is related to the size of its neocortex. Dunbar theorized that the Dunbar number for a human being is 100-250.

## 6. Human nature and judgment

### 6.1. Trust

The modern world operates fundamentally on trust, familiar trust is generally a given, but we also choose to trust chefs, clerks, drivers, executives, etc. 

### 6.2. Bias from incentives

Humans have perhahps the most varied and complicated set of incentives in the animal kingdom. This causes us to distort our thinking when it's in our own interest to do so, such as a salesman truly believing that his product will improve the lives of its users: the fact that he sells the product causes a very real bias in his own thinking.

### 6.3. Pavlovian association

Animals can respond not just to direct incentives, but also to associated objects. Human beings are similar and can feel positive and negative emotion towards intangible objects, while the emotion comes from past associations rather than direct effects.

### 6.4. [Tendency to feel envy and jealousy](https://www.farnamstreetblog.com/2016/08/mental-model-bias-envy-jealousy/)

Humans tend to feel envious of those receiving more than them. The tendency towards envy is strong enough to drive otherwise irrational behavior, but is as old as humanity itself.

### 6.5. [Tendency to distort due to liking/loving](https://www.farnamstreetblog.com/2016/09/mental-model-bias-from-liking-loving/) or [disliking/hating](https://www.farnamstreetblog.com/2016/09/bias-from-disliking-hating/)


Humans tend to distort their thinking in favor of people/things that they like and against people/things they dislike -> we overrate things we like and underrate or broadly categorize things we don't, often missing crucial nuances in the process.

### 6.6. Denial

Anyone who's been alive long enough realizes that "denial isn't just a river in Africa". This is demonstrated in situations like war or drug abuse, where denial has powerful destructive effects but allows for behavioral inertia. Denying reality can be a coping mechanism, a survival mechanism, or a purposeful tactic.

### 6.7. [Availability heuristics](https://www.farnamstreetblog.com/2011/08/mental-model-availability-bias/)

We tend to most easily recall what is saliend, important, frequent, and recent. The brain has its own energy-saving and inertial tendencies that we have little control over, such as the availability heuristics. Having a truly comprehensive memory would be debilitating.

### 6.8. Representativeness heuristics

The three major psychological findings that fall under Representativeness, also defined by Kahneman and Tversky:

1. [Failure to account for base rates](https://www.farnamstreetblog.com/2012/11/mental-model-bias-from-insensitivity-to-base-rates/): an unconscious failure to look at past odds in determining current or future behavior.
2. Tendency to stereotype: tendency to broadly generalize and categorize rather than look for specific nuance. This is generally a necessary trait for energy-saving in the brain.
3. Failure to see false conjunctions: students chose more vividly described individuals as more likely to fit into a predefined category than individuals with broader, more inclusive, but less vivid descriptions, even if the vivid example was a mere subset of the more inclusive set.

### 6.9. [Social proof](https://www.farnamstreetblog.com/2009/09/mental-model-social-proof/), safety in numbers

Humans are a social species, we have a DNA-level instinct to seek safety in numbers and will look for social guidance of our behavior. This instinct creates a cohesive sense of cooperation and culture which would not otherwise be possible but also leads us to do foolish things if our group is doing them as well.

### 6.10. [Narrative instinct](https://www.farnamstreetblog.com/2016/04/narrative-fallacy/)

Humans have an instinct to construct and seek meaning in narrative. It’s likely that long before we developed the ability to write or to create objects, we were telling stories and thinking in stories.

### 6.11. Curiosity instinct

This instinct leads to unique human behavior and forms of organization such as the scientific enterprise. Even before there were direct incentives to innovate, humans innovated out of curiosity.

### 6.12. Language instinct

The idea that grammatical language is not a simple cultural artifact was first popularized by the linguist Noam Chomsky. This instinct is used to create shared stories, gossip, solve problems and fight. Grammatically ordered language theoretically carries infinite varying meaning.

### 6.13. First-conclusion bias

The mind works a bit like sperm and egg: the first idea gets in and then the mind shuts. This is probably an energy-saving technique, but our tendency to settle on first conclusions leads us to accept many erroneous results and stop asking questions. 

### 6.14. [Tendency to overgeneralize from small samples](https://www.farnamstreetblog.com/2013/05/mental-model-bias-from-insensitivity-to-sample-size/)

It's important that we generalize, we don't need to see every instance to understand the general rule. But sometimes we make mistakes when we oversee the law of large numbers and we generalize too much. We take a small number and create a general category, even if we have no statistically sound basis for the conclusion.

### 6.15. Relative satisfaction/misery tendencies

The envy tendency is related to the state of the person relative to either teir past or their peers, not the absolute state of the person. These relative tendencies cause us great misery or satisfaction and make us poor predictors of our own behavior and feelings.

### 6.16. [Commitment and consistency bias](https://www.farnamstreetblog.com/2016/08/commitment-consistency-bias/)

Humans are subject to a bias towards keeping their prior commitments and staying consistent with our prior selves when possible. Yet our bias towards staying consistent can become a 'hobglobin of foolish minds', when combined with the first-conclusion bias.

### 6.17. [Hindsight bias](https://www.farnamstreetblog.com/2009/08/what-is-hindsight-bias/)

Once we know the outcome, it’s nearly impossible to turn back the clock mentally. Our narrative instinct leads us to reason that we knew it all along (whatever “it” is), when in fact we are often simply reasoning post-hoc with information not available to us before the event. The hindsight bias explains why it’s wise to keep a journal of important decisions for an unaltered record and to re-examine our beliefs when we convince ourselves that we knew it all along.

### 6.18. [Sensitivity to fairness](https://www.farnamstreetblog.com/2011/09/mental-model-kantian-fairness-tendency/)

We are careful arbiters of what's fair, yet fairnes seems to be a moving target. What is seen as fair and just in one time and place may not be in another.

### 6.19. Tendency to overestimate consistency of behaviour, [fundamental attribution error](https://www.farnamstreetblog.com/2016/08/fundamental-attribution-error/)

We tend to over-ascribe the behavior of others to their innate traits rather than to situational factors, leading us to overestimate how consistent that behavior will be in the future. In such a situation, predicting behavior seems not very difficult. This assumption is consistently demonstrated to be wrong, and we are consequently surprised when others do not act in accordance with the “innate” traits we’ve assigned them.

### 6.20. Influence of stress

Stress causes both mental and physiological responses and tends to amplify the other biases. Almost all human mental biases become worse in the face of stress as the body goes into a fight-or-flight response, relying purely on instinct without the emergency brake of Daniel Kahneman’s “System 2” type of reasoning. Stress causes hasty decisions, immediacy, and a fallback to habit, thus giving rise to the elite soldiers’ motto: 

“In the thick of battle, you will not rise to the level of your expectations, but fall to the level of your training.”

### 6.21. Survivorship bias

History is famously written by the victors. We over-attribute success to things done by the successful agent rather than to randomness or luck, and we often learn false lessons by exclusively studying victors without seeing all of the accompanying losers who acted in the same way but were not lucky enough to succeed.

### 6.22. [Tendency to want to do something](https://www.farnamstreetblog.com/2015/06/do-something-syndrome/)

Most humans have the tendency to need to act, even when their actions are not needed. We also tend to offer solutions even when we do not enough knowledge to solve the problem.

### 6.23. [Falsification](https://www.fs.blog/2014/02/peter-cathcart-wason-falsification/) or [confirmation bias](https://www.fs.blog/2017/05/confirmation-bias/)

What we wish, we believe. And what we believe is what we choose to see. This is commonly referred to as the confirmation bias. It is a deeply ingrained mental habit, both energy-conserving and comfortable, to look for confirmations of long-held wisdom rather than violations.

The modern scientific enterprise operates under the principle of falsification: A method is termed scientific if it can be stated in such a way that a certain defined result would cause it to be proved false. Pseudo-knowledge and pseudo-science operate and propagate by being unfalsifiable.

## 7. Microeconomics and strategy

### 7.1. Opportunity costs

We live in a world of trade-offs, doing one thing means not doing another. 

### 7.2. Creative destruction

Motivated by personal incentives (including but not limited to financial profit), entrepreneurs will push to best one another in a never-ending game of creative one-upmanship, in the process destroying old ideas and replacing them with newer technology.

### 7.3. [Comparative advantage](https://www.farnamstreetblog.com/2009/08/should-tiger-woods-mow-his-own-lawn-the-principles-of-comparative-advantage/)

Two individuals, firms, or countries could benefit from trading with one another even if one of them was better at everything. Comparative advantage is best seen as an applied opportunity cost: If it has the opportunity to trade, an entity gives up free gains in productivity by not focusing on what it does best.

### 7.4. Specialization (pin factory)

Specializing provides gains in a free-market system. Rather than having a group of workers each producing an entire item from start to finish, it’s usually far more productive to have each of them specialize in one aspect of production. However, that each worker might not enjoy such a life; this is a trade-off of the specialization model.

### 7.5. Seizing the middle

In chess, the winning strategy is usually to seize control of the middle of the board. The same strategy works profitably in business.

### 7.6. Trademarks, patents and copyrights

These three concepts, along with other related ones, protect the creative work produced by enterprising individuals, thus creating additional incentives for creativity and promoting the creative-destruction model of capitalism. Without these protections, information and creative workers have no defense against their work being freely distributed.

### 7.7. Double-entry bookkeeping

The double-entry system requires that every entry, such as income, also be entered into another corresponding account. Correct double-entry bookkeeping acts as a check on potential accounting errors and allows for accurate records and thus, more accurate behavior by the owner of a firm.

### 7.8. Utility (marginal, diminishing, increasing)

The usefulness of additional units of any good tends to vary with scale. Marginal utility allows us to understand the value of one additional unit, and in most practical areas of life, that utility diminishes at some point. On the other hand, in some cases, additional units are subject to a “critical point” where the utility function jumps discretely up or down. As an example, giving water to a thirsty man has diminishing marginal utility with each additional unit, and can eventually kill him with enough units.

### 7.9. Bottlenecks

The place at which a flow is stopped. A bottleneck can be small but have a disproportionate impact if it's in the critical path.

### 7.10. Bribery

Given the chance, it is often easier to pay a certain agent to look the other way than to follow the rules. The enforcer of the rules is then neutralized. 

### 7.11. Arbitrage

Given two markets selling an identical good, an arbitrage exists if the good can profitably be bought in one market and sold at a profit in the other.

The only gas station in a 50-mile radius is also an arbitrage as it can buy gasoline and sell it at the desired profit (temporarily) without interference. Nearly all arbitrage situations eventually disappear as they are discovered and exploited.

### 7.12. [Supply and demand](https://www.farnamstreetblog.com/2009/07/mental-model-supply-and-demand/)

Economic entities compete for limited customer wealth and limited demand for their products. The point at which supply and demand for a given good are equal is called an equilibrium; however, in practical life, equilibrium points tend to be dynamic and changing, never static.

### 7.13. Scarcity

Given a certain situation and a limited amount of resources and time, what decisions are competitors likely to make, and which should they make? One important note is that traditional game theory may describe humans as more rational than they really are.

### 7.14. [Mr Market](https://fs.blog/2013/11/mr-market/)

The markets are a bit like a moody neighbor, sometimes waking up happy and sometimes waking up sad – your job as an investor is to take advantage of him in his bad moods and sell to him in his good moods. This attitude is contrasted to an efficient-market hypothesis in which Mr. Market always wakes up in the middle of the bed, never feeling overly strong in either direction.

## 8. Military and war

### 8.1. Seeing the front

One of the most valuable military tactics is the habit of “personally seeing the front” before making decisions – not always relying on advisors, maps, and reports, all of which can be either faulty or biased.

Leaders of any organization can generally benefit from seeing the front, as not only does it provide firsthand information, but it also tends to improve the quality of secondhand information.

### 8.2. Asymmetric warfare

One side seemingly “plays by different rules” than the other side due to circumstance. Unable to out-muscle their opponents, asymmetric fighters use other tactics, as with terrorism creating fear that’s disproportionate to their actual destructive ability.

### 8.3. Two-frond war

When Russia and Germany became enemies in WWII, Germany was forced to split its troops and send them to separate fronts, weakening their impact on either front. In practical life, opening a two-front war can often be a useful tactic.

### 8.4. [Counterinsurgency](https://www.farnamstreetblog.com/2017/06/counterinsurgency/)

Though asymmetric insurgent warfare can be extremely effective, over time competitors have also developed counterinsurgency strategies. Recently and famously, General David Petraeus of the United States led the development of counterinsurgency plans that involved no additional force but substantial additional gains. Tit-for-tat warfare or competition will often lead to a feedback loop that demands insurgency and counterinsurgency.

### 8.5. [Mutually assured destruction](https://www.farnamstreetblog.com/2017/06/mutually-assured-destruction/)

The stronger two opponents become, the less likely they may be to destroy one another. This also happens in business, as with the avoidance of destructive price wars between competitors.
